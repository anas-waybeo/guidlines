### **üöÄ Professional Git Strategy for Merging a Hotfix Branch**  
When dealing with a **hotfix**, you want to ensure that:  
1. The **hotfix is merged into `master`** (because it contains production code).  
2. The **hotfix is merged into `development`** (so future releases also include the fix).  

---

## **üõ† Recommended Strategy:**
- First, **merge `hotfix` into `master`** and tag it.  
- Then, **merge `hotfix` into `development`** to keep everything in sync.  

---

## **‚úÖ Step-by-Step Git Commands**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure You Are on the `hotfix` Branch**
```bash
git checkout hotfix-branch
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Pull Latest Changes to Avoid Conflicts**
```bash
git pull origin hotfix-branch
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Hotfix into `master` (Production)**
```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix-branch -m "Merge hotfix into master"
git push origin master
```
‚úÖ **Explanation:**  
- `--no-ff` ensures a **commit history is maintained** instead of fast-forwarding.  
- We use `-m` to add a commit message for clarity.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Tag the Release on `master` (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix release v1.2.1"
git push origin v1.2.1
```
‚úÖ **Why?**  
Tagging helps track versions and roll back if needed.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Merge Hotfix into `development` (To Keep Future Releases Consistent)**
```bash
git checkout development
git merge --no-ff hotfix-branch -m "Merge hotfix into development"
git push origin development
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Delete the Hotfix Branch (If No Longer Needed)**
```bash
git branch -d hotfix-branch
git push origin --delete hotfix-branch
```
‚úÖ **Why?**  
- Deleting the branch **keeps the repo clean** after the fix is merged.

## **üìå Summary of the Workflow**
| Branch | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `hotfix-branch` | **Fix the bug** |
| `master` | Merge `hotfix-branch` ‚Üí `master` and **tag a new release** |
| `development` | Merge `hotfix-branch` ‚Üí `development` to keep it updated |
| `hotfix-branch` | Delete after merging (if no longer needed) |

### **üöÄ Advanced Tip: Automate Versioning**
If you use **CI/CD tools** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), you can automate tagging and deployment of hotfixes.
